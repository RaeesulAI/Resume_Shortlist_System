# Resume_Shortlist_System
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the resume shortlisting process. By comparing key sections of resumes and job descriptions (skills, work experience, education, projects, and certifications), the system calculates a matching score to help recruiters identify the most suitable candidates efficiently.

Key Features:
Automated Resume Matching: Uses LLMs to perform semantic comparisons between resumes and job descriptions.
Customizable Weighting: Adjusts the importance of different resume sections based on the job role.
Ranking and Shortlisting: Provides ranked lists of candidates based on their match scores.
User Dashboard: Allows recruiters to view, filter, and analyze shortlisted candidates.
Scalability and Integration: Built with modern technologies like RAG, LangChain, and cloud services for deployment and scalability.
This system significantly reduces the time and effort required for initial resume screening, ensuring a more accurate and efficient hiring process.
